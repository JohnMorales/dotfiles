## Issues

Currently doesn't install java, java is a PITA to automate, but simply using `java --request` seems to bring up a dialog with the correct url to download java


## Prompt

I've moved customizing the prompt to be machine specific, as for certain machines (mostly work where I can't change the hostname, I want a different prompt) it's using [pureline](https://github.com/chris-marsh/pureline)
